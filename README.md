## Blobs

This repository contains all the modules needed for an application. From creation of a blob, write it to a particular storage sink to read that blob back anytime you want. A blob can be any data that you may need to store somewhere for future need, preferably request and response data of a service. 

This library is divided into two for different types of usages: 

1. <strong>Standalone</strong>
	
    * [Example](https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/blobs-example)
    * [Internals](stores/README.md)
    
2. <strong>Haystack</strong>

	* [Example](https://github.com/ExpediaDotCom/span-blob-example)
	* [Internals](haystack-blobs/README.md)
	
	For more information on haystack please refer [this](https://expediadotcom.github.io/haystack/).
